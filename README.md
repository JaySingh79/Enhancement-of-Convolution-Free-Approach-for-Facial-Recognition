# Kaggle Kinship Challenge - Transformer-based Convolution-Free Approach

This project implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) based model for the Kaggle Kinship Challenge, following a convolution-free approach for facial kinship recognition.

## Structure
- `src/` - Source code for data loading, preprocessing, model, training, and evaluation
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Steps to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Download the Kaggle Kinship dataset and place it in a `data/` folder.
3. Run training: `python src/train.py`
